THE AUTOMATION TOOL:  
- uses Node for core processing
- npm to manage project dependencies
- git for managing source code / versioning 
- vorpal for creating shell prompts and commands (in future versions) 
- Will look into ways/tools to make installation easier: 
    - considering using a container system like docker-jenkins  

INSTALLING NODE: (Mandatory)
- Simply download installer at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    - Use the LTS version (it is the most stable)
    - I'm not using bleeding edge node features so current version won't be necessary 
        - Any V5 or higher will work. 
- This will install npm onto the machine 

INSTALLING GIT SCM: (Optional)
- Download installer here
    - https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Use default options 
    - Install git bash if you want to use bash cli commands 

AFTER INSTALLING GIT/NODE/NPM...
    IF USING WINDOWS CMD PROMPT: 
    - Make sure to add any binaries to windows path environment variables. 
        Right click Computer --> Advanced System settings --> Advanced (tab) --> Environment Variables 
    - ADD THE FOLLOWING PATHS (if they aren't already added): 
        - C:\Program Files\nodejs\
        - C:\Program Files\Git\cmd 
        - C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin

    IF USING GIT BASH: 
    - Follow steps above... 
    - You can add bash Configurations to the .bashrc file of your home directory 
        - Home directory === User directory 
    - Switch your integrated terminal setting to use git bash: 
    - ADD THIS LINE TO YOUR CONFIG: 
        "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
	Or if your files are in a different location:
	"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Users\\<userName>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"

DOWNLOADING THE SOURCE CODE (AUTOMATION TOOL): 
- To download the source code make sure you have git installed. 
- Use git Source Code Manager to download/clone the files for the application to your local machine

    IN YOUR TERMINAL / COMMAND LINE: 
    1) Go to the directory where you wish to download to 
    2) Type in: git clone https://github.com/bant-webmd/automation-tool.git
        - This will "clone" the git repository to your current directory  

UPDATING THE TOOL: 
- Over time I will be adding new features and fixing bugs 
- To receive these updates open your command-line / terminal and: 
    1) Navigate to the root directory of the automation-tool (where package.json is)
	- Use "cd" command to change directory inside of the terminal/command line 
		- *** TIP you can type the first few letters of the directory and by hitting tab it will autocomplete 
	- Use "ls" to list contents of current directory
	- EXAMPLE COMMAND: cd automation-tool
		- This will go into the root directory of the automation-tool 
    2) Type in: 
	- To reset local changes 
		- type: git reset --hard
	- Pull in any updates hosted on github. 
		- type: git pull origin master 		
	- Install missing dependencies (Use this if getting "no such module" error):
		- type: npm install
	- run module tests - generates output files
		- type: npm run test
